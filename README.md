# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
## VUEX
I implemented vuex , but for some reason it did not render. So, I could not do it for some reason.
The plan was to have different extract the description of different domains and then , show them when I hover over them.

## Form
I implemented the formsubmit.co

## Login 
I was not sure what was expected. But I have used Firebase for Authentication previously.
